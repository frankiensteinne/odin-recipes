  <div class="description">Pad Thai is a Thai noodle stir fry with a sweet-savoury-sour sauce scattered with crushed peanuts. It's made with thin, flat rice noodles, and almost always has bean sprouts, garlic chives, scrambled egg, firm tofu and a protein - the most popular being chicken or prawns/shrimp.</div>

    <h2 class="subheading">Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><em>Cook noodles</em> according to package instructions, just until tender.  Rinse under cold water.</li>
      <li><em>Make sauce</em> by combining sauce ingredients in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
      <li><em>Stir fry.</em> Heat 1Â½ tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan or wok over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp, chicken or tofu, garlic and bell pepper. The shrimp will cook quickly, about 1-2 minutes on each side, or until pink. If using chicken, cook until just cooked through, about 3-4 minutes, flipping only once.</li>
      <li>Push everything to the side of the pan. Add a little more oil and add the beaten eggs. Scramble the eggs, breaking them into small pieces with a spatula as they cook.</li>
      <li>Add noodles, sauce, bean sprouts and peanuts to the pan (reserving some peanuts for topping at the end). Toss everything to combine.</li>
      <li><em>Garnish</em>the top with green onions, extra peanuts, cilantro and lime wedges. Serve immediately!</li>
      <li>Store leftovers in the fridge and enjoy within 2-3 days.</li>
    </ol>
